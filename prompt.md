Prompt for Next Session:

I’m continuing work on Project Shield, a modular Flutter password manager (monorepo: apps/app, packages/core, packages/ui, packages/api_client).

Stack: Flutter 3.10+, Dart, Riverpod, Melos, Docker
Git workflow: release branches, tags, PRs
Latest release: v0.0.1 (MVP features, modular credential management, Trash Can, import/export, feature toggling, docs updated)
Main branch is stable and up to date.
My goals for this session:

[Describe your next milestone or feature, e.g. “Implement Milestone 4: Data Import/Export improvements” or “Add Passkey support”]
[List any specific files, features, or bugs you want to work on]
[Mention any workflow or best-practice requirements, e.g. “Use conventional commits”, “Write unit tests”, “Update documentation”]
Please help me plan, track todos, and implement best-practice solutions for these goals.
